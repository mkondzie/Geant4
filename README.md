# Geant4 HIγS Simulation
A Geant4-based simulation for the High-Intensity Gamma-Ray Source (HIγS) at Duke University, designed to handle up to 10<sup>10</sup> primary monoenergetic photons. The main focus is on Compton scattering, with small scattering angles considered to estimate beam attenuation. 

## Requirements
Geant4-11.0.2 or later

ROOT-6.30.04 or later
